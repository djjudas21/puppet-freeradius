listen {
	#  Type of packets to listen for.
	#  Allowed values are:
	#	auth	listen for authentication packets
	#	acct	listen for accounting packets
	#	proxy   IP to use for sending proxied packets
	#	detail  Read from the detail file.  For examples, see
	#               raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	#	status  listen for Status-Server packets.  For examples,
	#		see raddb/sites-available/status
	#	coa     listen for CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request
	#		packets.  For examples, see the file

	#  Note: "type = proxy" lets you control the source IP used for
	#        proxying packets, with some limitations:
	#
	#    * A proxy listener CANNOT be used in a virtual server section.
	#    * You should probably set "port = 0".
	#    * Any "clients" configuration will be ignored.
	#
	#  See also proxy.conf, and the "src_ipaddr" configuration entry
	#  in the sample "home_server" section.  When you specify the
	#  source IP address for packets sent to a home server, the
	#  proxy listeners are automatically created.

	#  ipaddr/ipv4addr/ipv6addr - IP address on which to listen.
	#  If multiple ones are listed, only the first one will
	#  be used, and the others will be ignored.
	#
	#  The configuration options accept the following syntax:
	#
	#  ipv4addr - IPv4 address (e.g.192.0.2.3)
	#  	    - wildcard (i.e. *)
	#  	    - hostname (radius.example.com)
	#  	      Only the A record for the host name is used.
	#	      If there is no A record, an error is returned,
	#	      and the server fails to start.
	#
	#  ipv6addr - IPv6 address (e.g. 2001:db8::1)
	#  	    - wildcard (i.e. *)
	#  	    - hostname (radius.example.com)
	#  	      Only the AAAA record for the host name is used.
	#	      If there is no AAAA record, an error is returned,
	#	      and the server fails to start.
	#
	#  ipaddr   - IPv4 address as above
	#  	    - IPv6 address as above
	#  	    - wildcard (i.e. *), which means IPv4 wildcard.
	#	    - hostname
	#	      If there is only one A or AAAA record returned
	#	      for the host name, it is used.
	#	      If multiple A or AAAA records are returned
	#	      for the host name, only the first one is used.
	#	      If both A and AAAA records are returned
	#	      for the host name, only the A record is used.
