  #  See raddb/certs/README for additional comments

  #
  #  If OpenSSL was not found at the time the server was
  #  built, the "tls", "ttls", and "peap" sections will
  #  be ignored.
  #
  #  If you do not currently have certificates signed by
  #  a trusted CA you may use the 'snakeoil' certificates.
  #  Included with the server in raddb/certs.
  #
  #  If these certificates have not been auto-generated:
  #    cd raddb/certs
  #    make
  #
  #  These test certificates SHOULD NOT be used in a normal
  #  deployment.  They are created only to make it easier
  #  to install the server, and to perform some simple
  #  tests with EAP-TLS, TTLS, or PEAP.
  #
  #  See also:
  #
  #  http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,9286052~mode=flat
  #
  #  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
  #  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
  #  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
  #  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.
