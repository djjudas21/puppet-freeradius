  #  Syslog facility (if logging via syslog).
  #  Defaults to the syslog_facility config item in radiusd.conf.
  #  Standard facilities are:
  #  - kern        Messages generated by the kernel.  These cannot
  #                be generated by any user processes.
  #  - user        Messages generated by random user processes.
  #                This is the default facility identifier if
  #                none is specified.
  #  - mail        The mail system.
  #  - daemon      System daemons, such as routed(8), that are not
  #                provided for explicitly by other facilities.
  #  - auth        The authorization system: login(1), su(1),
  #                getty(8), etc.
  #  - lpr         The line printer spooling system: cups-lpd(8),
  #                cupsd(8), etc.
  #  - news        The network news system.
  #  - uucp        The uucp system.
  #  - cron        The cron daemon: cron(8).
  #  - authpriv    The same as LOG_AUTH, but logged to a file
  #                readable only by selected individuals.
  #  - ftp         The file transfer protocol daemons: ftpd(8),
  #                tftpd(8).
  #  - local[0-7]  Reserved for local use.

  #  - alert       A condition that should be corrected immediately,
  #                such as a corrupted system database.
  #  - critical    Critical conditions, e.g., hard device errors.
  #  - error       Errors.
  #  - warning     Warning messages.
  #  - notice      Conditions that are not error conditions, but
  #                should possibly be handled specially.
  #  - info        Informational messages.

  #                only when debugging a program.

  #  The default format string.

  #  If it is defined, then the string is dynamically expanded,
  #  and the result is used to find another configuration entry
  #  here, with the given name.  That name is then used as the
  #  format string.
  #
  #  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
  #  message is printed.

  #  i.e. You can have many log messages in one "linelog" module.
